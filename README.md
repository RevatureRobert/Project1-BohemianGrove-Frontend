  ## User Authentication 
  
  We used BCrypt a hash algorithm to safely encrypt the user's password when logging on and making a new account. We also used UUID to ensure unqiue identifier       for each user.
   
  ## Search Bar
  
  The search bar allows users to search for user handles. The user's input queries the database and returns the closest      
  matches.
