## Features 

  ## User Authentication 
  
  We used BCrypt a hash algorithm to safely encrypt the user's password when logging on and making a new account. We also used UUID to ensure unqiue identifier       for each user.
   
  ## Search Bar
  
  The search bar allows users to search for user handles. The user's input queries the database and returns the closest matches.
  
  ## CRUD
  
  We allow users to create, delete, and update their accounts and their post accordingly
  
  
## Future Goals!
  
  We plan to implement follow, likes and comment functionality in the near future and even making our application mobile friendly!
